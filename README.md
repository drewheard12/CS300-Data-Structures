# CS300-Data-Structures

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Determining the correct data structure to efficiently organize and work with large amounts of data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Its important to understand all data structures in order to select the one that is most effecient at the task you have in mind. You can do this by calculating a runtime analysis on the different structures.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The feedback given during this course was a great teacher for me. The further we got into the course and the more feedback I recieved, the more I understood. I had to visit a lot of forums like stack overflow to assist me in executing my ideas.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
All of this work really gave me a lot of experience with structures in general, and it greatly helped me get into more of an object oriented mindset when it comes to coding.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working with data structures made it very simple to compartmentalize my code. Being able to organize my code into better defined functions, classes, or methods will greatly boost the efficiency of my future code.
